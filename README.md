# Ultimate Volcanic Mine
Think of this plugin as an update to some of the previous ones.
I have also added some new features.

Features from other plugins:

1) Vent Shift Notification:
If enabled, sends a warning notification prior to the vents resetting, using the specified time below

2) Vent Shift Warning Time:
   The advance notification (in seconds) before vents reset

3) Eruption Notification:
      If enabled, sends a warning notification prior to the volcano erupting, using the specified time below

4) Eruption Warning Time:
   The advance notification (in seconds) before the volcano erupts

5) Cap Counter: Keeps track of the number of times that a user caps

- I have fixed an issue with these now they will work 100% of the time 

6) Platform Despawn Notification:
   If enabled, sends a notification when the platform the player is standing on is in its final state before disappearing

7) Vent Fix Notification: Sends a notification when the Mine Stability drops below 100%
8) Stability Update Tracker: Tracks changes to the mine stability

- This will now keep track of three changes rather than just two.

New features from my plugin:

1) Rock Timers: Starts a timer when a rock is taken
2) Vent Status Prediction: Estimates what a single unidentified vent value would be based on changes to
stability and the values of the other two vents
3) Future Stability Estimation: Determines future stability changes based on the values
from Vent Status Prediction or if all three vents are identified
